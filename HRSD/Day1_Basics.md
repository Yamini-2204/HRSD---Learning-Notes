HRSD stands for Human Resources Service Delivery - This is the current used module in ServiceNow.
It is a scoped application.
In Previous HRSM( Human resources Service Management) is used, it is a global Application.
Here we have to know about what is Scoped application and Global application.

Scoped application:
    means an application that runs inside its own namespace (scope), which isolates its tables, scripts, and data from other applications.
To understand clearly for suppose 2 projects running in one company. 
One of the project members are using scoped application so other project people cannot access to this scoped application.
Scoped application is like odc in a company only particular project people can access to that room.
Example:
  A Custom HR Onboarding App in the x_hr_onboarding scope that only HR agents can access.

Global application:
  An application that runs in the global scope, meaning no namespace prefix and full access to all global tables and scripts.
Anyone can access, do modifications in worldwide.
Global application is like non odc in a company any employee can access across the company.
Example:
The Incident Management application in the global scope that interacts with ITSM, CMDB, and other modules.
